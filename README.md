Javascript and Jquery is used to create logic that allows the page visitor to interact with the page, move from page to page, read and consume information, highlight the active navbar item that is being viewed for convenience, projects presented in a carousel slider format as well as additional project information presented in a modal popup

CSS is used for a number of things including the styling theme of the app, font theme, layout and structure, responsiveness from mobile to desktop, some effects, etc

Approach: My approach was to have navigation links and social links visible no matter what for easy access and have the different content display controled by the navbar. The logic i put together would present the site content similar to a single page web application

Unsolved problems: I had some trouble trying to figure out on my own how to improve my javascript code DRY-ness, that's definitely an area of improvement
